# Classification-of-Datasets

## Description
There are five datasets, and for each dataset, I am provided with the training data, training label and test data. I use the training label and training data to build a classifier to accurately predict the test label

## Utilized Web Application 
I used the open-source web application Jupyter Notebook to create an interactive document that allowed me to implement Python code in cells, which are executed as steps in chronological order.

## Features
-Building a classifier and predicting the test label
-Gaining analysis and evaluation on the efficiency of the classifiers
